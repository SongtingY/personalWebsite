# Intro

Hello! I'm Songting Yang, currently navigating my first year of a Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Fresh from completing dual bachelor's degrees in Finance and Business Analytics & IT from Rutgers and South China University of Technology, I've had a front-row seat to the incredible tech transformations around the globe.

My ambition? To create seamless platforms that elevate user experiences and enable intelligent decision-making. Eager to fuel progress, I'm on a quest to deepen my tech expertise through graduate studies and can't wait to share my innovative explorations with the world. Let's shape the future together!

# Some history

####  A Journey of Growth and Discovery
-  I embarked on an academic adventure that began with the rigorous Chinese College Entrance Examination, known for its intensity, and emerged with a spot at SCUT, diving into Business Administration. When the opportunity for a dual degree program arose, I leaped at the chance to broaden my horizons at Rutgers, where I embraced Finance, a field that captivated my curiosity. It was here, in the intersection of Business Analytics and Information Technology (BAIT), that I discovered the allure of coding. This newfound passion for programming led me down an exciting path, guiding me to choose Computer Science as my graduate school focus. It's a journey of numbers, strategy, and code â€“ and I'm just getting started!

#### Bridging Insights with Technology: My Leap into Computer Science
- Before Rutgers, dabbling in Python was a pragmatic choiceâ€”my first steps were crafting simple scripts to cut down repetitive tasks, sparking my realization of how technology can serve us. Majoring in BAIT and Finance, I initially eyed a career as a Data Analyst (DA), a role I believed to be at the intersection of data and business acumen. Hands-on projects and mentorships later illuminated a crucial insight: to truly excel as a DA and provide transformative business insights, one must delve into the engine room of data â€” the technology itself.

- This revelation propelled me into CS classes, where my interest transformed into a passion. Accepted into the Codepath program, the rigor of technical interview preparation, particularly the methodical problem-solving of Leetcode, became a daily ritual that I came to relish. With every problem unraveled, my proficiency and enjoyment grew.

- Side projects became a canvas for my burgeoning skills, each line of code and each feature I implemented solidified my decision. The troubleshooting, the collaboration, the eureka momentsâ€”it wasn't just about finding solutions; it was about crafting a path that felt innately mine.

- Buoyed by this sense of accomplishment and the allure of deepening my technical expertise, I applied to Northeastern University's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence program, ready to not just face the future but to help shape it.

#### From Yunnan to the World: My Voyage of Discovery
- Hailing from a quaint city in China's Yunnan province, I was acutely aware of the divide between my upbringing and that of the urban dwellers. Yet, my father, a man of great foresight, endeavored to bridge this gap. He instilled in me a worldly perspective, guiding me through travels that wove through the vast tapestry of China's cities. At the tender age of 12, I found myself navigating Europe's diversity, and by 13, I was soaking in the cultural depths of Laos, followed by the vibrant life of Thailand at 14. These journeys were more than just travels; they were my foray into the global community, challenging myself to communicate with locals in English, pushing through the difficulties to emerge more worldly and wise.

- At 15, an American summer camp beckoned, where I immersed myself in the local way of life. There, sports became my universal language, creating friendships and learning in a land of freedom that sparked a curiosity within me. What if I could live here, experience life's myriad possibilities? Visiting Silicon Valley later crystallized this aspiration, as I was drawn to its pulsating innovation.

- Fortune smiled upon me as I became part of a dual degree program, culminating in a bachelor's degree in New Jersey and an exciting leap into Silicon Valley to pursue my graduate studies in Computer Science. Each step on this journey has been a building block towards understanding our interconnected world, and each discovery a testament to the boundless possibilities that await.
